Improvements to the cargo and passenger resupply UI.

[h1]Cargo[/h1]
[list]
[*]New column shows how much of each resource/rover/prefab your colony currently has.
[*]Resource numbers are color-coded for how long the current supply plus shipment will last
[list]
[*]White when infinite (production >= consumption + maintenance)
[*]Red when less than 5 sols
[*]Yellow when less than 10 sols
[*]Green otherwise
[/list]
[*]Resource tooltips include current resource usage and runway until stockpiles are exhausted.
[/list]

[h1]Passengers[/h1]
[list]
[*]Interests and Demographics summary of selected applicants added on the left.
[*]Applicant selections are no longer cleared if you go back to the filter. Currently selected applicants will always be shown even if they no longer match the filter.
[*]Individual filter critera can now be clicked to review all applicants with that trait. The rest of the filter criteria will be used to sort the applicants. Beware: thumbs down on other criteria will not prevent them from showing up in this view.
[/list]

[i]Want to make sure that Genius or Celebrity is included? Just click on those traits to show matching applicants and thumbs them up. Need to also bring 3 Engineers and a Scientist? Click on those filter criteria to see only applicants with those specialties to select. Now it's easier than ever to pick exactly who you want to bring to Mars![/i]
